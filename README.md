# 🐛 Optimising Real-Time Pest Monitoring System | Computer Vision, Machine Learning, OpenCV

This project presents an approach to optimize pest monitoring systems by integrating real-time image processing and classification models. The solution is tailored for deployment in smart agriculture systems using edge or cloud computing.

## 💡 Project Objectives

- Detect and classify agricultural pests from image data.
- Improve early warning systems for crop infestation.
- Integrate image preprocessing (grayscale, resizing, normalization) with ML/DL techniques for robust predictions.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- OpenCV
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow / Keras (as needed)
- Matplotlib, NumPy

## 📂 Project Structure

- `optimising real time pest monitoring system.ipynb`: Main notebook for preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and classification.
- Image data (not included in this repo) should be structured into labeled directories for training and validation.

## 🚀 Features

- Image pre-processing pipeline using OpenCV.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for pest type distributions.
- Machine learning model (e.g., Decision Tree / SVM) for pest classification.
- Evaluation metrics like accuracy and confusion matrix.
- Scalable for deployment with IoT-enabled field traps.

## 📈 Sample Results

The notebook includes:
- Preprocessed image samples.
- Classification accuracy visualization.
- Performance comparison among different models.

## ✅ Future Improvements

- Integrate with cloud-based real-time dashboards.
- Expand dataset with region-specific pests.
- Use YOLO or Faster R-CNN for object detection-based pest counting.
